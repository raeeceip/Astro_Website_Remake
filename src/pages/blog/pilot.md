# Psychology to Computer science

As a young Nigerian, the reality that at some point in your eductional journey, a stable(or better yet profitable) career is only possible when the choice is made to move out of the country, and pursue a career abroad. Being a student whose career choice had been psychology, I could not avoid facing that reality eventualy.

So when I applied to and got  admitted to study Psychology in Ottawa, Canada , I was overjoyed, but I knew I has to prepare, so as not to waste the "opportunity". I started taking two courses, one on [Social Psychology]() and one on [Python Programming fundaentals]() to ensure that my career would be the absolute best it could be, and I would be ready for my first semester.

However, as I began my studies, I realized that something was missing. Despite my initial enthusiasm for psychology, I found myself more and more drawn to programming. I paidless attention to my social psychology classes and devled more into computer science: I  loved the problem-solving aspect of it and the endless possibilities for creativity and innovation.

And so a new fear arose , switching  my major (again). I was worried that I would be seen as not being able to stick to something, or that my interests would lead to me not having a successful career. I had already gone from Medicine to Pharmacy to Psychology, and that was supposed to be my final change. But then I realized that this opportunity to study abroad was a chance for me to chase my passions and do what truly made me happy.

So, I made the decision to switch my major to computer science and become a software developer. It was a scary move, but I am confident that it is the right one for me. I hope that by following my dreams, I can create a better life for myself and make a positive impact in the world.

As I continue on this journey, I am grateful for the support of my friends and family, and for the opportunity to study in a country that values education and personal growth. I am excited to see what the future holds and to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way.


>Note: As at the time of this post's creation, I have not yet changed my major, as the semester is already in session. But I do intend to, and will update you when I do
